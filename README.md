# hello-world-c
This is made to test your C compiler and programming skills. The goal is to compile hello.c (C) or hello.cpp (C++) to hello.exe. To compile the file on WIndows, first, you need to have to installed MinGW, do all of those installation and system path variable things and type this: "gcc -o hello.exe hello.c" and "gcc -o hello.exe hello.cpp" for C++ .

It's actually quite simple, "init"?
Get it, Python... but British??

Anyways, it's really simple.
